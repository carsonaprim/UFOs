# UFOs
## Overview
In this project we are using our new JavaScript skills to create a webpage to be able to filter through data for UFO sightings based on location, date, or type of UFO seen.

In the webpage shown above, the categories are listed on the left, and if Dana wanted to search for NC for example, just type in the state box and it will filter! The date, country, city, and type of sighting are also options for searching!!
## Summary
One drawback of the webpage is that it is limited in adding new data and it should be possible to report new findings in it. I would say further development should add where input is an option, as well as adding a spot for pictures/descriptions in a forum-style way to make it more in depth.
